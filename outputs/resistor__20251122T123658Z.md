## Summary

**Topic: Trigonometry**

**Definition:**

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, particularly right triangles. It involves the study of triangles with specific angles and the ratios of their side lengths.

**Detailed Explanation:**

Trigonometry builds upon the concept of geometry and algebra. It uses mathematical functions, such as sine, cosine, and tangent, to describe the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. These functions are used to solve problems involving right triangles, circular functions, and wave patterns.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Angles:** Trigonometry deals with angles measured in degrees or radians. Angles can be acute (less than 90°), right (90°), or obtuse (greater than 90°).
2. **Triangles:** Trigonometry is concerned with right triangles, where one angle is 90°. The sides of a right triangle are the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), the base, and the height.
3. **Trigonometric Functions:**
	* **Sine (sin):** The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
	* **Cosine (cos):** The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
	* **Tangent (tan):** The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
	* **Cotangent (cot):** The reciprocal of tangent.
	* **Secant (sec):** The reciprocal of cosine.
	* **Cosecant (csc):** The reciprocal of sine.

**Examples:**

1. **Right Triangle:** In a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 inches and a base of 6 inches, find the height:
	* sin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse = height / 10
	* cos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 6 / 10
	* tan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side = height / 6
2. **Circular Function:** Find the value of cos(30°):
	* cos(30°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2

**Important Formulas:**

1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** a² + b² = c² (where a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse)
2. **Trigonometric Identities:**
	* sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 (Pythagorean identity)
	* tan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ)
	* cot(θ) = cos(θ) / sin(θ)
	* sec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ)
	* csc(θ) = 1 / sin(θ)

**Summary Bullets:**

* Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with triangles and their angles.
* Trigonometric functions describe the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles.
* Key concepts include angles, triangles, and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.).
* Important formulas include the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric identities.
