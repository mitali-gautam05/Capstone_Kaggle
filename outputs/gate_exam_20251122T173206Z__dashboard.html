## Summary

**GATE Exam Study Notes**

**Overview:**
The GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam is a competitive test held in India for admission to postgraduate programs in engineering and technology. It is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

**Key Points:**

1. **Eligibility:** The exam is open to Bachelor's degree holders in Engineering/Technology/Architecture or Master's degree holders in any branch of Science/ Humanities/ Social Science. The age limit is 28 years (with a 3-year relaxation for SC/ST/PwD candidates).

2. **Exam Pattern:** The exam consists of a single paper with multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and numerical answer type (NAT) questions. The paper is divided into two parts: General Aptitude (30% of total marks) and Subject-specific questions (70% of total marks).

3. **Subjects:** The exam is offered in 27 different subjects, including Engineering, Technology, and Architecture.

4. **Marking Scheme:** Each correct answer is awarded 1 mark, while each incorrect answer carries a penalty of 1/3 mark.

5. **Cutoff:** The cutoff marks vary for different categories and subjects. Candidates are shortlisted based on their performance in the exam.

**Example:**
Suppose a candidate scores 65% in the exam and the cutoff for their category is 60%. They will be shortlisted for the next round of admission.

**Final Summary:**
The GATE exam is a competitive test for admission to postgraduate programs in engineering and technology. It consists of a single paper with multiple-choice and numerical answer type questions, and the cutoff marks vary for different categories and subjects.
